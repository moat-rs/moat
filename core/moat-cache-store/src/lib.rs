//! Bounded asynchronous chunk access over moat's engine pipelines.
//!
//! Each disk has a worker that exclusively owns a v2 session, queue and pool. Compatible
//! reads share one physical operation and one reference-counted buffer. Reads,
//! overwrites and deletions of a ChunkId follow admission order; unrelated IDs
//! can be in flight together. No source loader, logical key codec or cache
//! eviction policy is embedded here.
//!
//! Requests are admitted when a method returns its [`Request`], before polling
//! the future. Dropping a future abandons its reply, not an accepted mutation.
//! Completed read buffers retain byte credits until their last shared owner
//! drops them. [`Store::close`] drains admitted operations and releases engines.
