# moat

A chunkserver built for machines with many large NVMe drives.

***Work in progress. The on-disk format and APIs are not stable yet.***

moat stores immutable, variable-length chunks (from a few bytes up to a
configurable maximum, 4 MiB by default) on raw NVMe devices, with one
independent log-structured engine per disk, an RDMA data path, and a client
library that stripes arbitrarily large objects across disks and nodes. It is
designed to be correct first, fast second, and as small as those two allow.

The design document lives at [`docs/design/chunkserver.md`](docs/design/chunkserver.md).

## Status

| Crate | Purpose | State |
|---|---|---|
| [`moat-common`](core/moat-common) | Chunk identifiers, CRC32C block checksums, page alignment, huge-page arenas and the buddy buffer pool | usable |
| [`moat-engine`](core/moat-engine) | Single-disk engine: segments, index, GC, recovery; io_uring with registered buffers, zero-copy read and write paths | usable on raw devices, files and in memory |
| `moat-transport` | RDMA (verbs) and TCP transports behind one protocol | planned |
| [`moat-server`](core/moat-server) | Multi-disk node: NVMe discovery, placement, recovery and workers | usable without a network transport |
| [`moat-cache-memory`](core/moat-cache-memory) | Sharded weighted resident cache, shared handles, FIFO/LRU/TinyLFU/S3FIFO/SIEVE | implemented; [design and contracts](docs/design/cache-memory.md) |
| [`moat-cache-store`](core/moat-cache-store) | Bounded async engine adapter and physical read coalescing | implemented; [design and contracts](docs/design/cache-store.md) |
| [`moat-cache`](core/moat-cache) | Hybrid cache, stable key identity, disk catalog and conditional population | implemented; [design and contracts](docs/design/cache-hybrid.md) |
| `moat-client` | Node routing, connection management, large-object striping | planned |
| `moat-tools` | `format`, `fsck`, `dump`, `bench` | planned |

`moat-cache::Cache` returns owned key/value views over shared read buffers.
Views remain readable after eviction, overwrite and shutdown; callers control
their lifetime by retaining or dropping entry/field handles. See the
[view API and retention limits](docs/design/cache-views.md), or run
`cargo run -p moat-cache --example views`.

## Trying the engine

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use moat_common::ChunkId;
use moat_engine::{
    FileDevice, FormatOptions, Options, PutOptions, QueueBackend, QueueOptions, blocking,
};

let device = Arc::new(FileDevice::create("disk.img", 64 << 30, /* direct */ false)?);
moat_engine::format(&*device, &FormatOptions::default())?;

let (engine, _) = moat_engine::open(device, Options::default())?;
let mut queue = QueueOptions::default().build(QueueBackend::Auto)?;
let mut writer = engine.writer(queue.as_mut())?;
let mut reader = engine.reader(queue.as_mut())?;

let id = ChunkId::from_u128(1);
writer.put(queue.as_mut(), id, b"hello", PutOptions::default())?;
blocking::flush(queue.as_mut(), &mut writer)?;
assert_eq!(
    blocking::get(queue.as_mut(), &mut reader, &id, None)?.as_deref(),
    Some(&b"hello"[..]),
);
blocking::seal(queue.as_mut(), &mut writer)?;
writer.detach(queue.as_mut());
reader.detach(queue.as_mut());
```

On Linux, each worker owns an io_uring queue and registered buffers. Its readers
and writers share that queue across disks; each disk has a single writer.
Values move between buffers and the device without copies
(`Writer::prepare_large` / `put_large` for writes,
`ChunkData` for reads). `cargo bench -p moat-engine` measures throughput and
latency on a file or, with `MOAT_BENCH_DEVICE`, a raw device (which it
**formats**).

`cargo test --workspace` runs the unit tests plus the engine's crash-injection,
reclaim and randomized model tests, including file-backed io_uring tests on
Linux. Allow at least 64 MiB of locked memory for the Linux test process;
registered buffer pools need headroom while queues close and reopen. CI sets
this limit explicitly. Benchmarks need a limit sized for their configured
per-worker pools.

Server-side payload CRC verification is disabled by default
(`Options::verify_reads = false`). Set it to `true` to verify the record header
and every 64 KiB checksum block touched by each read. Unchecked reads cover
only the requested pages. Checksum generation and recovery/reclaim validation
are unchanged.
Client-side transport and verification are not implemented yet.

## Local development on macOS

macOS uses regular files and synchronous I/O for functional development and
testing. To try it:

```sh
cargo run -p moat-engine --example local
cargo test --workspace
```

The example writes and reads a 4 KiB chunk, reopens the temporary file to
verify recovery, and removes the file on exit.
`QueueOptions::build(QueueBackend::Auto)` selects io_uring on Linux and
`SyncQueue` on macOS; `QueueBackend::resolve()` reports the selection.
Initialization errors on Linux are returned directly. Explicitly selecting
`Uring` on macOS returns `Unsupported`; `MemDevice` on Linux requires an
explicit `Sync` selection.

The synchronous backend performs blocking I/O on the caller's thread and
delivers results through the same `poll`/completion interface. It is intended
for development, not the performance path. Reader, Writer, and the disk format
are shared by both backends.
On macOS, use `FileDevice::create/open(..., false)`. Explicit requests for
direct I/O, CPU pinning, or required huge pages return `Unsupported`.
The default huge-page policy falls back to plain mappings. Workers default to
`Auto`, without CPU pinning, and sleep when idle.
NVMe discovery remains Linux-only; macOS callers supply file devices explicitly.

## Benchmarking

The [disk cache comparison](benchmarks/cache-disk/README.md) reports the bytes-only
moat cache and pinned foyer on one and twenty data disks with matched application
and I/O worker counts. The [published results](benchmarks/cache-disk/reports/2026-09-10/REPORT.md)
include all concurrency levels and known limitations. Raw host inventories,
device identities and local profiling artifacts are not part of the repository.
The [memory comparison](benchmarks/cache-memory/README.md) covers resident hit
cost across replacement policies and key sizes.
Run the engine benchmark without additional configuration to use a temporary
4 GiB file. The benchmark enables `O_DIRECT` when the backing filesystem
supports it and falls back to buffered I/O otherwise.

```sh
cargo bench -p moat-engine
```

To benchmark a block device, pass its path explicitly:

```sh
MOAT_BENCH_DEVICE=/path/to/block-device \
MOAT_BENCH_BYTES=$((64 << 30)) \
cargo bench -p moat-engine
```

**The benchmark formats `MOAT_BENCH_DEVICE` and destroys data on it. Never use
a system disk or a device containing data you need.** Device paths are examples
only and must not be committed as project configuration.

The workload can be adjusted with the following environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `MOAT_BENCH_BYTES` | Bytes exercised by the benchmark | 4 GiB |
| `MOAT_BENCH_READERS` | Concurrent reader threads | 1 |
| `MOAT_BENCH_LARGE` | Large-value size in bytes | 1 MiB |
| `MOAT_BENCH_SMALL` | Small-value size in bytes | 4 KiB |
| `MOAT_BENCH_VERIFY` | Enable CRC verification on every read in the engine and node benchmarks | unset |
| `MOAT_BENCH_SYNC` | Use the blocking queue instead of io_uring when set | unset |

Benchmark results are hardware-specific. Published results should include the
CPU, storage device, kernel, filesystem or raw-device mode, benchmark variables,
and the corresponding `fio` configuration when making comparisons.

## Development

See the [development guide](docs/README.md) for the repository layout,
suggested reading order, and design document index.

Rust stable (see `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`). Development tasks follow the
[cargo-xtask](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask) convention and are run
through the `cargo x` alias:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cargo x` | The default suite: `tools`, `check`, `test`, `udeps`, `license`, `doc` |
| `cargo x tools [-y]` | Installs the helper tools the other tasks need (`typos`, `taplo`, `cargo-sort`, `cargo-machete`, `cargo-nextest`, `license-eye`) |
| `cargo x check` | Spelling, TOML and Rust formatting (applied in place, nightly rustfmt when available), clippy with warnings denied |
| `cargo x test` | `cargo nextest run` plus doctests |
| `cargo x udeps` | Unused dependencies |
| `cargo x license` | Apache 2.0 header check (`.licenserc.yaml`) |
| `cargo x doc` | `cargo doc` with warnings denied |

`cargo x tools` installs helper binaries under `CARGO_HOME`; when it is unset,
the standard `$HOME/.cargo` location is used. Downloaded archives are kept in a
temporary directory and removed after installation.

Run `cargo x` before opening a pull request; CI runs the same checks.
