# moat

A chunkserver built for machines with many large NVMe drives.

***Work in progress. The on-disk format and APIs are not stable yet.***

moat stores immutable, variable-length chunks (from a few bytes up to a
configurable maximum, 4 MiB by default) on raw NVMe devices, with one
independent log-structured engine per disk, an RDMA data path, and a client
library that stripes arbitrarily large objects across disks and nodes. It is
designed to be correct first, fast second, and as small as those two allow.

The design document lives at [`docs/design/chunkserver.md`](docs/design/chunkserver.md).

## Status

| Crate | Purpose | State |
|---|---|---|
| [`moat-common`](core/moat-common) | Chunk identifiers, CRC32C block checksums, page alignment, huge-page arenas and the buddy buffer pool | usable |
| [`moat-engine`](core/moat-engine) | Single-disk engine: segments, index, reclaim/eviction, recovery; io_uring with registered buffers, zero-copy read and write paths | usable on raw devices, files and in memory |
| `moat-transport` | RDMA (verbs) and TCP transports behind one protocol | planned |
| `moat-server` | Multi-disk node: NVMe discovery, placement, admission, workers | planned |
| `moat-client` | Node routing, connection management, large-object striping | planned |
| `moat-tools` | `format`, `fsck`, `dump`, `bench` | planned |

## Trying the engine

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use moat_common::ChunkId;
use moat_engine::{FileDevice, FormatOptions, Options, PutOptions, QueueOptions};

let device = Arc::new(FileDevice::create("disk.img", 64 << 30, /* direct */ true)?);
moat_engine::format(&*device, &FormatOptions::default())?;

let opened = moat_engine::open(device, Options::default())?;
let (mut writer, reader) = (opened.writer, opened.reader);
let mut ring = reader.ring(&QueueOptions::default())?; // one per reading thread

let id = ChunkId::from_u128(1);
writer.put(id, b"hello", PutOptions::default())?;
writer.flush()?;
assert_eq!(ring.get_sync(&id, None)?.as_deref(), Some(&b"hello"[..]));
```

The writer and every read ring own an io_uring instance and a pool of
pre-registered, huge-page backed buffers; values move between those buffers and
the device without copies (`Writer::prepare_large` / `put_large` for writes,
`ChunkData` for reads). `cargo bench -p moat-engine` measures throughput and
latency on a file or, with `MOAT_BENCH_DEVICE`, a raw device (which it
**formats**).

`cargo test --workspace` runs the unit tests plus the engine's crash-injection,
reclaim and randomized model tests against an in-memory device.

## Benchmarking

Run the engine benchmark without additional configuration to use a temporary
4 GiB file. The benchmark enables `O_DIRECT` when the backing filesystem
supports it and falls back to buffered I/O otherwise.

```sh
cargo bench -p moat-engine
```

To benchmark a block device, pass its path explicitly:

```sh
MOAT_BENCH_DEVICE=/path/to/block-device \
MOAT_BENCH_BYTES=$((64 << 30)) \
cargo bench -p moat-engine
```

**The benchmark formats `MOAT_BENCH_DEVICE` and destroys data on it. Never use
a system disk or a device containing data you need.** Device paths are examples
only and must not be committed as project configuration.

The workload can be adjusted with the following environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `MOAT_BENCH_BYTES` | Bytes exercised by the benchmark | 4 GiB |
| `MOAT_BENCH_READERS` | Concurrent reader threads | 1 |
| `MOAT_BENCH_LARGE` | Large-value size in bytes | 1 MiB |
| `MOAT_BENCH_SMALL` | Small-value size in bytes | 4 KiB |
| `MOAT_BENCH_SYNC` | Use the blocking queue instead of io_uring when set | unset |

Benchmark results are hardware-specific. Published results should include the
CPU, storage device, kernel, filesystem or raw-device mode, benchmark variables,
and the corresponding `fio` configuration when making comparisons.

## Development

Rust stable (see `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`). Development tasks follow the
[cargo-xtask](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask) convention and are run
through the `cargo x` alias:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cargo x` | The default suite: `tools`, `check`, `test`, `udeps`, `license`, `doc` |
| `cargo x tools [-y]` | Installs the helper tools the other tasks need (`typos`, `taplo`, `cargo-sort`, `cargo-machete`, `cargo-nextest`, `license-eye`) |
| `cargo x check` | Spelling, TOML and Rust formatting (applied in place, nightly rustfmt when available), clippy with warnings denied |
| `cargo x test` | `cargo nextest run` plus doctests |
| `cargo x udeps` | Unused dependencies |
| `cargo x license` | Apache 2.0 header check (`.licenserc.yaml`) |
| `cargo x doc` | `cargo doc` with warnings denied |

`cargo x tools` installs helper binaries under `CARGO_HOME`; when it is unset,
the standard `$HOME/.cargo` location is used. Downloaded archives are kept in a
temporary directory and removed after installation.

Run `cargo x` before opening a pull request; CI runs the same checks.
